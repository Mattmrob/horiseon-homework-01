    <!-- 'hero' is a class with an assigned background image that scales properly and fits behind the header -->
    <!-- If an img tag is used in replacement for the css background-image property, then the image will stretch and squish in an unintended manner depending on screen size -->
    <!-- For accessibility, because an alt tag cannot be applied to a background-image, a descriptive title is used instead and appears when mousing over the div -->

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
